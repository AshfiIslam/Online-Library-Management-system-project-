  First, let’s have a look at the reasoning behind career goals.

Career goals are basically a statement, a goal, that you have decided that you’d like to achieve for your career. You might have goals for the other areas of your life, such as financial or life goals, but the career goals are just focused on your career.

These career goals can be focused on achieving a specific job title or area of expertise, working for a specific company, or getting a role in a certain industry. We all should have career goals. It provides the direction and motivation that we need to get ahead in our careers.

<p class="p-3">Becoming a programmer isn't just about learning the syntax and the concepts of a programming language: it's about figuring out how to use that knowledge to make programs. You've made a bunch of programs in this course, in the challenges and projects, but now you should come up with ideas for new programs - ideas that you're personally really excited about - and try to turn those into actual programs.
You probably won't know everything you need for your program when you start it, and that's totally okay -- you'll be motivated to learn those new things because of how much you want to make your program real. Programmers are constantly learning new things for new projects, and that's part of why we love it so much.</p>

<h1 class="pb-3">Becoming a Teacher</h1>
<p><h6 class="pb-3">One of the most important things to determine when becoming a teacher is deciding what age group and what subjects you want to teach. If you would like to teach a wide variety of subjects, the elementary school grade level is probably a good choice. If you prefer to specialize in one particular subject, such as biology, algebra, or a foreign language, the middle or high school level would be more suitable. When making this decision, keep in mind the basic demand for particular types of teachers in your area. Some subjects and/or grade levels may have a significant need for new teachers, while other segments may be flooded with current teachers and new applications.</h6></p>

<p><h6 class="pb-3">We are all travellers. It is in our DNA, as generations before us have dedicated their lives to explore planet Earth to find the best places to settle. We are the result of great nomads who fearlessly explored jungles, climbed mountains and crossed seas, just to find a place they can call home. Our ancestors didn’t seek attractions, nor travelled for any other purpose but to discover their real selves. So is this what it really means to be a traveller?

Traditionally, we’ve allowed ourselves to be inspired by others, movies, commercials and magazines. We’ve been eagerly dreaming of the day when we will be travelling, taking selfies and parade our achievements. In the process, we’ve been saving money like crazy, made lists of things to do and forgot to live just so we can buy that precious holiday.</h6></p>
